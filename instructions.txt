Here are some basic instructions on how to convert a video:

1)Add video frames to "frames" folder
	- This can be done a plethora of ways but if you're unsure how, I would personally use FFMPEG (A few sample commands are in the "ffmpeg.txt" file)
	- Ensure frames have a [frame%4d] naming scheme (ffmpeg makes this very easy)
	- Ensure frames have a standard resolution. (I've had weird issues with nonstandard sizes)
2)In the chess_renderer.py file change the resolution and multiplier to your liking
	-Resolution: The resolution of the ouput frames. Ensure these have the same ratio as the input frames
	-Multiplier: Changes the number in pieces used to fill the screen. Play around with this number to get desired results
3)Run chess_renderer.py
	- Ensure you run this from the same directory or else it wont see the files
4)Convert generated frames to video
	- Similar to step 1, I would use ffmpeg but whatever gets the job done
